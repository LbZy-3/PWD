# PWD Plane wave decomposition Toolkit

# Contents
This package contains simple programs used to simulate how scalar electromagnetic waves scatters and propagates from a nearfield plane object to farfield

It can efficiently calculate the scalar field diffraction patterns : 
* **Scattering:** Compute how electromagnetic waves scatter off a plane source object to farfield through vacuum


This repository contains the following folders: 

* **matlab:** This folder contains matlab programs (also compatible with octave)

* **python:** This folder contains python programs 

* **notebook:** This folder contains a jupyter notebook example
